Red-Black tree module with Kivy front-end
==============

Overview
--------------

This project was written to provide visual interaction with Red-Black trees.

The tree module may be imported directly from another application.  Instead, a user may interface with it using the Kivy framework.  Please find details at kivy.org.

I have provided the buildozer spec if anyone wishes to reproduce the Android apk with the buildozer tool, also created by the folks maintaining Kivy.
